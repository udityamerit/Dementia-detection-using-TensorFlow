# 🧠 Dementia Care Suite - Comprehensive Monitoring System

## 📌 Overview
The **Dementia Care Suite** is an AI-powered healthcare application designed for early detection and monitoring of dementia. It leverages **deep learning (PyTorch LSTM model)**, **speech & image analysis**, and **cognitive assessments** to provide a holistic view of a patient's cognitive health.

## 🚀 Features
- **Cognitive Health Prediction** using deep learning (LSTM model)
- **Speech Analysis** using NLP sentiment detection
- **Image Recognition** for detecting abnormalities in medical scans
- **Cognitive Assessment Tests** with interactive scoring
- **Performance Tracking** with historical trend analysis
- **Data Management** (Export, Clear, and Erase records)
- **User-Friendly UI** built with Streamlit

## 🛠️ Installation
### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd dementia-care-suite
```
### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### **3️⃣ Run the Application**
```bash
streamlit run dementia_care_suite.py
```

## 📊 How It Works
1. **Upload Patient Data** (Voice Sample, Medical Images, Health Metrics)
2. **Run Cognitive Assessment** (Interactive test)
3. **Generate Risk Analysis Report** (Predicted Cognitive Health Score)
4. **Track Historical Data** (Visualize trends over time)
5. **Download Reports or Manage Data** (Export or erase patient records)

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- **Python** (Streamlit, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Transformers, Torchvision)
- **Machine Learning** (LSTM Neural Network, Sentiment Analysis, Image Processing)
- **Data Visualization** (Plotly, Matplotlib)

## 📄 Dataset Information
This tool works with dementia-related datasets such as:
- [DementiaBank Pitt Corpus](https://dementia.talkbank.org/)
- [ADReSS Challenge Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spsayakpaul/alzheimers-detection-dataset)

## 📝 Future Improvements
- Integration with **wearable devices** for real-time tracking
- Enhancing **speech and movement analysis** for early detection
- Deployment as a **cloud-based web service**
